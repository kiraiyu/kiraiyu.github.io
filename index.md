# Daniel Le's Portfolio

I am a Computer Science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2026. I like using C++ as it provides a challenge everytime and it helps me understand how different fucntions work together simultaneously. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4 part 1

Lab 4 had two parts– part 1 was my favorite because I essentially played with cin and cout functions. 
The math portion was also fun because I had to find the real-life measurement conversions and apply them to the code, which did the
math for me when I input a specific measurement that I needed to convert. Working with doubles helped strengthen my ability to differentiate 
the usage of doubles, integers, and boolean functions. My partner and I split the lab into parts, so I got to do part 1 while he did part 2. 
Looking at Part 2 was interesting and a little more challenging, and I would like to practice with if-else statements. 


Lab 10 

Lab 10 was very challenging for me, but it was still fun, as always. Using vectors more often would help me 
understand how they work and the functions they need to compile correctly. Using constructors is also a new topic for me, and it gave me a 
bit of a challenge regarding this lab. Interestingly, the code output gives the county’s name and population! 


Lab 11

Lab 1’s part 1 was challenging in its own way, but it was still fun to complete, as this one made me think I achieved something after completing it independently.
This lab required using vectors and completing constructors, which gave me better understanding of how they work in code. 
It taught me a little more about the “stoi” and the “stod” functions. Part 2 was very similar to Lab 4’s part 2, in which I compared the code together, and it 
seemed more straightforward in Lab 11 as it had boolean and voids. Boolean functions are typically used for true or false situations; in this case, it was guessing a 
secret number in which the user inputs a number, and the bool functions test whether it is too small or too big.
